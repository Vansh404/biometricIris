# biometricIris
In this project, we use Hough circles to implement image segmentation after it has been filtered. Then normalization is performed to convert the polar, circular form of the iris into a rectangular block
Feature extraction is carried through by Gabor wavelets. Here, phasors are extracted from the rectangular blocks, with their phase angles being used to quantise bits. 
We then compare the distance between the two irises using a hardcoded threshold.
